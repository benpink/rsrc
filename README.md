# RSRC

RSRC is an opinionated library for managing async fetch operations in React.


## What problem are we solving?

The goals of this project are:

1. to reduce dependence on common boilerplate for fetch operations 
2. to encourage a declarative approach to fetching 
3. to encourage the collocation of resource desciptors with the components that
   depend on them


## What does this do?

## Getting started

Requires __React 16.3 or later__.

```
